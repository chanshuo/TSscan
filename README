Manual of TSscan

1. System Requirement

The TSscan pipeline is executed on the 64-bit Linux operation system (e.g., Bio-Linux 6; also see 
http://nebc.nerc.ac.uk/ for more information). The BLAT and BFAST aligners can be downloaded at 
http://genome.ucsc.edu/ (the UCSC Genome Browser) and http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/bfast/, 
respectively.

2. Preparation

The initial input data include the reference sequences, the long read data and the short read data.

2.1 Reference sequences

The following three data sets are retrieved from the reference sequences (e.g., hg19 or GRCh37).

 (1) Date set 1: the whole reference genomic sequences.  
 The whole reference genomic sequences should be completely downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser,
 which includes the sequences from chromosomes and the mitochondrion genome and the 
 unplaced/unlocalized sequences (i.e., chr*_random and chrUn_*).
 
 (2) Data set 2: the processed mitochondrion genomic sequences. 
 The mitochondrion genomes are formed in a circular fashion. To comprehensively detect possible
 fusion sequences in the mitochondrion genomes, for each mitochondrion genome we generate a copy and
 then assemble these two copies together. Such generated genomic sequences are designated as 
 "processed mitochondrion genomic sequences". The processed mitochondrion genomic sequences can be
 generated by the mitochondrion genome with following UNIX instructions.

    head -1 chrM.fa > chrM.title 
    cat chrM.fa | grep -v "^>" > chrM.seq 
    cat chrM.title chrM.seq chrM.seq > RepChrM.fa 
 
 (3) Data set 3: the annotated RNA sequences. 
 The annotated RNAs are downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser and the Ensembl Genome Browser 
 (http://www.ensembl.org/â€Ž).    

To minimize mapping errors due to unsequenced gaps, it would be better to detect trans-splicing
candidates on a model species with high-quality genomic sequences and annotations.

2.2 Long read data

The polyA tails of the 454-reads should be removed, and the raw sequencing data of the long 
454-reads should be converted into a fasta format. 

2.3 Short read data

The raw sequencing data of the short reads should be converted into a fastq format.

After that, install all data sets and the TSscan files in the same folder.
During the process of TSscan, do not move any file or change any file name.

3. The Pipeline of TSscan

The TSscan processes include the following steps (see Fig. 1).

 Step 1: Identifying chimeric RNA candidates by BLAT-aligning long reads against the reference
 genome.

 1.1: Mapping the long reads onto the Data set 1 (the whole reference genomic sequences) by BLAT
  
 Example: blat RefGenome.fa longreads.fa out_step1_1.psl
  
 Note: If the BLAT alignments are processed by chromosomes, all the results should be integrated
 into a file in a psl format and be sorted according to the long read IDs (i.e., "query ID", the
 10th column of the psl-formatted file).

 1.2 TSscan1of4 out_step1_1.psl longreads.fa out_step1_2.fa

 Usage:
 TSscan1of4 [psl] [fasta] [output] 
 [psl]       the result of the BLAT-alignment between the long reads and the reference genome.  
 [fasta]     the long reads in a fasta format. 
 [output]    name of the output file.
 

 1.3 Mapping the output file of Step 1.2 into the Data set 2 and Data set 3 (the processed
 mitochondrion genomic sequences and the annotated RNA sequences) by BLAT
 
 Example: blat out_step1_2.fa longreads.fa out_step1_3.psl

 1.4 TSscan2of4 RefRNA.blat longreads.fa out_step1_4.fa

 Usage:
 TSscan2of4 [psl] [fasta] [output]
 [psl]       the output file of step 3.
 [fasta]     the long reads in a fasta format.
 [output]    name of the output file. 

 1.5 Mapping the output file of Step 1.4 into the unplaced/unlocalized sequences (i.e., chr*_random
 and chrUn_*) by BLAT
 
 Example: blat out_step1_4.fa longreads.fa out_step1_5.psl

 1.6 TSscan3of4 out_step1_5.psl longreads.fa out_step1_6.fa

 Usage:
 TSscan3of4 [psl] [fasta] [output] 
 [psl]       the output file of Step 1.5.
 [fasta]     the long reads in a fasta format.
 [output]    name of the output file.

 Step 2 Excluding candidates without the support of short RNA-Seq reads.
 
 2.1 Mapping the short reads into the output file of Step 1.6 by BFAST
 
 Note: Please see the BFAST page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/bfast/files/ for details.
 
 2.2 
 For illumina RNA-Seq reads:
 cat out_step2_1.sam | ./TSscanSamParser.NT out_step1_6.fa > out_step2_2.sam 

 For color space reads (SOLiD reads):
 cat out_step2_1.sam | ./TSscanSamParser.CS50 out_step1_6.fa > out_step2_2.sam 

 Note: TSscan-parsing the output of Step 1.6. For the current version, the length of illumina
 RNA-Seq reads is limited to 50 bases and the length of the color space reads must be exactly 50
 bases. 
 
 2.3 cat shortreads.fastq | ./FastqOut out_step2_2.sam 1 > out_step2_3.fastq
 
 Note: Extracting short reads which remain in the output SAM file of Step 2.2. 
 
 2.4 Mapping the output file of Step 2.3 into the Data sets 1~3 by BFAST. All the SAM files are
 then merged into a SAM file 
 
 Note: Please see the BFAST page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/bfast/files/ for details.
 
 2.5 TSscan4of4 out_step2_2.sam out_step2_4.sam longreads.fa out_step2_5.out

 Usage:
 TSscan4of4 [sam1] [sam2] [fasta] [output] 
 [sam1]     result file of mapping short reads to junction sequences (in a SAM format).
 [sam2]     result file of mapping short reads to the reference genomic sequences (in a SAM format).
 [fasta]    the long reads in a fasta format.
 [output]   name of the output file.
   
 After that, the users can manually filter out potential experimental artifacts (Step 3 of Fig. 1) 
 and potential genetic rearrangement events (Step 4 of Fig. 1) by the criteria stated in the text
 and Figure 1.
